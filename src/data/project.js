We modify the model architecture by adding conditional control, converting the lines and user hints into style, and then generating the colorization result of the line art through this style. Our method indeed inherits the outstanding color quality of StyleGAN. It has a better saturation and naturalness in colorization results and has a better FID score than previous works.`,
