In this project, we train a swapping autoencoder model for  style transfer for anime character face. We can apply the style from one image into another image with this model.

For example:
* Apply the style from the right image into the left image.

    (left: input content, right: input style, middle: output result)

We add some special image style in our dataset, like the 3d rendered character. Now the model can do like 3d to 2d style transfer.

* 3d to 2d style transfer

We also add some line art image as our dataset for reference colorization.

* Use style transfer for line art reference colorizationm
